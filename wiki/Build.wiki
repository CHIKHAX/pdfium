#summary How to build the library

= Building PDFium=

==Prerequisites==
Install Python, Subversion, and Git and make sure they're in your path.

==Get the code==
{{{
git clone https://pdfium.googlesource.com/pdfium

cd pdfium
}}}


Now checkout a few projects that are needed to build.

First is [https://code.google.com/p/gyp/ GYP], which generates platform-specific build files from the gyp and gypi files.
{{{
svn co http://gyp.googlecode.com/svn/trunk build/gyp
}}}

Then the [https://code.google.com/p/v8/ V8] JavaScript engine which is used to evaluate script embedded in PDFs.
{{{
svn co http://v8.googlecode.com/svn/trunk v8
}}}

V8 depends on the ICU internationalization library. We fetch it from Chromium's repository.
{{{
svn co https://src.chromium.org/chrome/trunk/deps/third_party/icu46 v8/third_party/icu
}}}

For *Windows only*, we also need a Cygwin checkout which is used to generate some source files by V8:
{{{
svn co http://src.chromium.org/svn/trunk/deps/third_party/cygwin@231940 v8/third_party/cygwin
}}}


==Generate the build files==
Now we use the GYP library to generate platform-specific build files.

On Windows:
{{{
build\gyp_pdfium
}}}
For all other platforms:
{{{
build/gyp_pdfium
}}}
