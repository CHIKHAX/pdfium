#summary How to build the library

= Building PDFium=

==Prerequisites==
Install Python, Subversion, and Git and make sure they're in your path.

==Get the code==
{{{

mkdir pdfium
cd pdfium
gclient config --name . --unmanaged https://pdfium.googlesource.com/pdfium.git
gclient sync
}}}


==Generate the build files==
Now we use the GYP library to generate the build files.

At this point, you have two options. The first is to generate platform-specific build files, i.e. Makefiles on Linux, sln files on Windows, and xcodeproj files on Mac.

On Windows:
{{{
build\gyp_pdfium
}}}
For all other platforms:
{{{
build/gyp_pdfium
}}}

If you want to use the [http://martine.github.io/ninja/ Ninja] build system instead, set the GYP_GENERATORS environment variable to 'ninja' before running the above command.


==Building the code==
If you used Ninja, you can build the sample program by:
{{{
ninja -C out/Debug pdfium_test
}}}

If you're not using Ninja, then building is platform-specific.

On Linux:
{{{
make pdfium_test
}}}

On Mac, open build/all.xcodeproj

On Windows, open build\all.sln
